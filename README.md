This project has been initially given up on since i couldnt find as much enjoyment as i was working in mcity, this fork performs better and includes a few more features compared to hmcd union like hl2coop.
You'll have to manually designate the points yourself though due to gmod limitations

Hmcd Union: https://github.com/chechensky/hmcd_union (all credits go towards them for offering a base for me to work off of)

I am not sure if i want to release this on the workshop due to its incomplete nature, if you plan on forking this let me know in discord (kazoouh)
